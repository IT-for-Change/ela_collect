ELA Collect is powered by the excellent ODK Collect app. ELA is E Learning Assessment. The ELA app has customizations on top of the ODK collect app to support fully offline form download and submission upload where a desktop workstation acts as a server and runs the ELA server component. The name 'ELA' reflects the initial use case - teachers use the app to assess student performance.
